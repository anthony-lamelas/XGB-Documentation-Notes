# XGB Documentation Notes

This repository contains my personal notes and summaries based on the **official XGBoost (XGB) documentation**.

These notes are organized by key topics and features within XGBoost, such as:

- Categorical data handling  
- DART booster methods  
- Feature interaction constraints  
- Boosted tree fundamentals

## Purpose
These documents were created to deepen my understanding of XGBoost's core algorithms and functionality, and to serve as a quick reference.

Useful for anyone learning or working with gradient boosting in machine learning.
